CPSC483 Final Project: Face Emotion Recognition


Project Description:
- Our project aims to create a system that can accurately identify human emotions from facial expression. By using deep learning and computer vision techniques, we hope to develop a model thatâ€™s able to train on a diverse dataset of labeled facial images.
